UDP Pinger

The Pinger is an extremely simple python script composed of a socket creation and a for loop to send 10 ping messages to the server, timing each ping's response. I can't see any particular cases where this server would fail so long as it is paired with the appropriate server code. It could be expanded to use different IP addresses, but I decided it would be easier to use without having to enter this information manually.
